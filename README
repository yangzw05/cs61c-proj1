This repository contains the first project (Beargit) of the CS61c Course at UC Berkeley. I self-learned this course online.

Beargit - A simple implementation of git, with the only supported commands being init, add, rm, comit, branch, 
checkout, status, and log (written in C, with starting code being provided to us)
